## My process

### Built with

-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - React bundler
-   [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS utilities
-   [React hook form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - React hook form

### Continued development

Exercice validation is a bit simplist, we could add some more rules to check if the card has expired for example.
